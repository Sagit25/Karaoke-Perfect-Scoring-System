# Karaoke Perfect Scoring System
Seoul National University (Information Science and Culture)

Sound Interaction course project (2022 Fall)

## Project

This project began with the goal of implementing the Perfect Score system from karaoke rooms in the MAX language. Additionally, inspired by the Korean TV show 'Kkeutkkaji Ganda' (Going to the End), We decided to divide the lyrics into multiple sentences and display them on the screen. From a certain point onwards, users can choose the correct lyrics among the options provided. Additionally, for added entertainment, We created background videos to enhance the karaoke-like atmosphere and make the experience more enjoyable.

## Implementation

Using Max (Cycling' 74) MSP language

Designed the system to award points based on 'pitch' and 'rhythm' to mimic the perfect score system in karaoke.
